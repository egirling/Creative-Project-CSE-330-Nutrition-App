# Creative-Project-CSE-330-Nutrition-Site
This was the final project for the course CSE330S at Washington University in St. Louis. 
My partner Gautami Kankipati and I made a nutrition site using mySQL, React, and Php. 
The site features a pages where users can request workouts, make fitness or nutrition posts, request a recipe from another user and many more.
Users make an account and login to website and their passwords are hashed and salter to ensure security.
